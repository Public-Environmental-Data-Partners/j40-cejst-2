                  The CEJST uses datasets that are indicators of burden related to climate change and the environment to assess communities that are disadvantaged by these burdens. They are also related to health and lack of economic opportunity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tool highlights disadvantaged communities across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. Communities are shown on the map as disadvantaged:

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If they are on land within the boundaries of Federally Recognized Tribes
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Not all disadvantaged communities can be shown on the map. The map shows point locations for Alaska Native Villages. Some communities do not live in just one place. This tool focuses on identifying communities that can be geographically defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The tool uses census tracts. Census tracts are small units of geography. Census tract boundaries for

                   are determined by the U.S. Census Bureau once every ten years. The tool utilizes the census tract boundaries from 2010.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Tracts that were identified as disadvantaged in the 1.0 version of the tool remain disadvantaged in the 2.0 version of the tool.

                <p>
                  Due to limited data availability, tracts in American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are considered disadvantaged if they meet the low income threshold only.

                  No. The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) does not use racial demographics in its methodology. The current version of the tool displays data about race and age only to provide information when a census tract is selected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is well-documented that communities of color suffer disproportionately from environmental and health burdens. Due to decades of underinvestment, they also face greater risks from climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although the CEJST does not use race in its methodology, the tool creates a map that seeks to reflect the on-the-ground burdens and realities that disadvantaged communities face. The tool shows communities that have environmental burdens and face injustice.

The following data are used: projected flood risk, energy cost, lack of plumbing, lead paint, housing cost, proximity to hazardous waste facilities, proximity to Superfund or National Priorities List (NPL) sites, proximity to Risk Management Plan (RMP) facilities, diesel particulate matter exposure, traffic proximity and volume, underground storage tanks and releases, wastewater discharge, poverty, unemployment, and high school education. Linguistic isolation was removed for Puerto Rico based on feedback received during the beta period.

      To respect Tribal sovereignty and self-government and to fulfill Federal trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribal Nations, land within the boundaries of Federally Recognized Tribes are highlighted as disadvantaged on the map. Alaska Native Villages are included as point locations that are smaller than census tracts. The boundaries of census tracts and the lands of Federally Recognized Tribes are different.

                  Different areas of the map will have different colors because they are identified as disadvantaged in different ways. Some census tracts that contain land within the boundaries of Federally Recognized Tribes are also considered disadvantaged because they meet the burden thresholds for at least one of the categories on the tool. When this happens, the areas appear darker on the tool’s map.

                  A census tract that does not meet any of the burden thresholds in the tool is usually not considered to be a disadvantaged community. However, if such a census tract contains land within the boundaries of Federally Recognized Tribes, then the parts of the tract that contain the land of Tribes are considered disadvantaged. The tool will display this type of census tract as “partially disadvantaged.”

                  Several states have environmental justice screening tools. CalEnviroScreen is an environmental justice screening tool for California. Other states, like New York and Michigan have screening tools as well. The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) incorporates lessons learned from these efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is an important difference between state-based tools and the CEJST. State tools use data that may not be available for other states. The CEJST only uses data that are nationally-consistent and publicly-available.

                  Because some nationally-consistent datasets on indicators of environmental or climate burden used in the tool do not currently include data for certain U.S. Territories, tracts in these Territories are considered disadvantaged if they meet the low income threshold only.
